                <p>Worked in a group of two to create a project during the 36 hour Shellhacks hackathon. This website allowed you to log 
                    in and set reminders using the Twilio API that would send you or any recipient a text message at an indicated time. I was 
                    responsible for created the code to set the automatic reminder and then helped implement it into the rest of the code. 
                    Majority of the work was done using handlebars.
